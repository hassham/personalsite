    <h2>About Me 1</h2>
    <p>Hi, I‚Äôm Hasham ‚Äî a solutions architect, cloud enthusiast, and part-time myth-buster (mainly when someone says "This will only take five minutes") with years of experience across the corporate world and service sector.</p>

    <p>I specialize in building scalable, secure, and smart systems using both AWS and Azure, and have a deep appreciation for the magic of DevOps when done right. From automating CI/CD pipelines to designing cloud-native applications, I thrive at the intersection of tech and business ‚Äî where real problems need real solutions (and fewer PowerPoint slides).</p>
      
    <p>Over the years, I‚Äôve worked with startups trying to scale and enterprises trying to stay nimble. My toolkit includes everything from .NET development to infrastructure as code, from agile delivery to "How-did-you-even-think-of-that?" solutions.</p>
      
    <p>Outside the terminal window, I‚Äôm a proud dad to two little legends, who‚Äôve taught me more about negotiation and chaos management than any workshop ever could. I live in sunny Sydney, stay curious, and believe the best tech solutions begin with listening ‚Äî and maybe a bit of caffeine.</p>
      
    <p>If you're looking for someone who blends deep technical expertise with business insight, gets things done without drama, and even makes the occasional deployment feel fun ‚Äî let‚Äôs connect.</p>
