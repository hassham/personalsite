        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I'm Hasham — a solutions architect, cloud enthusiast, and part-time myth-buster (mainly when someone says "This will only take five minutes") with years of experience across the corporate world and service sector.</p>

        <p>I specialize in building scalable, secure, and smart systems using both AWS and Azure, and have a deep appreciation for the magic of DevOps when done right. From automating CI/CD pipelines to designing cloud-native applications, I thrive at the intersection of tech and business — where real problems need real solutions (and fewer PowerPoint slides).</p>

        <h2>What I Do</h2>
        <p>I'm the Senior Solutions Architect & DevOps Consultant at <a href="https://www.fujifilm.com/fbau/en" target="_blank">FUJIFILM Data Management Solutions</a>. We're building cutting-edge data management solutions that help organizations transform their operations.</p>

        <p>Over the years, I've worked with startups trying to scale and enterprises trying to stay nimble. My toolkit includes everything from .NET development to infrastructure as code, from agile delivery to "How-did-you-even-think-of-that?" solutions.</p>
